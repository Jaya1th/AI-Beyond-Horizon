Regular eye exams are paramount to monitor the progression of the disease, despite the inability to attend academic institutions. Maintaining optimal blood sugar levels through diet, exercise, and medication is crucial in slowing down the advancement of diabetic retinopathy. Concurrently, managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels is essential to mitigate further complications. Quitting smoking is imperative due to its exacerbating effects on the condition. Vigilance regarding any changes in vision is necessary, with immediate medical attention sought for symptoms like blurred vision or floaters. Following a prescribed treatment plan, which may involve laser therapy or surgery, is vital for managing the condition's severity. Additionally, wearing sunglasses to shield the eyes from sunlight exposure can help prevent worsening symptoms. Embracing a healthy lifestyle, staying informed about diabetic retinopathy, and seeking support from loved ones or support groups contribute to overall well-being and effective disease management."
